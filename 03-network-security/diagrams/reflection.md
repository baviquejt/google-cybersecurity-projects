Designing this high-level network architecture diagram helped me strengthen my understanding of how secure environments are structured and why each layer matters. Breaking the network into segments such as the DMZ, internal LAN, and server tiers reinforced the idea that strong security depends on controlling how traffic flows rather than relying on a single device or tool. It also highlighted the importance of placing controls in the correct parts of the network so that threats are detected early and contained before they reach sensitive systems.

I also gained a clearer view of how monitoring tools link everything together. Seeing the SIEM, IDS, and logging components in context made it easier for me to understand how security teams build visibility across an environment. The diagram shows how packet inspection, endpoint protection, and network monitoring work together to support fast detection and response. This has motivated me to continue improving my skills in packet analysis, log review, and threat detection because these tasks sit at the core of how a cybersecurity analyst helps keep an organisation secure.
