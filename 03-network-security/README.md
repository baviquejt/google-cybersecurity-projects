## 2. Why this topic matters  
A strong cybersecurity foundation begins with understanding how networks operate and how systems communicate. Security analysts must be able to read traffic, identify anomalies, secure network boundaries and evaluate risks across interconnected systems. This course allowed me to build hands-on fluency in network infrastructure, protocols and defensive controls that protect organisations from common threats.  

This module also formed the core basis for real SOC work because analysts identify attacks through logs, packet captures and network behaviours. Understanding how the network is built helps identify how it can break.

## 3. Content

### 3.1 Understanding network models  
I studied how data moves across networks through the TCP/IP model. Key responsibilities involve identifying issues across the Application, Transport, Internet and Network Access layers.  

Practical skills gained:  
- Interpreting how packets move between source and destination  
- Understanding the role of IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP in communication  
- Recognising how attacks exploit each layer  

---

### 3.2 Network hardware and infrastructure  
I learned how routers, switches, firewalls and wireless access points function within an organisation.  

Key takeaways:  
- Routers direct traffic between networks  
- Switches forward traffic within a network  
- Firewalls filter inbound and outbound traffic  
- Access control lists (ACLs) regulate traffic movement  

These components form the organisation’s first line of defence.

### 3.3 Securing networks with defensive controls  
I gained hands-on understanding of:  
- Packet filtering and stateful inspection  
- Firewall rules and traffic policies  
- VPNs and secure tunnelling  
- Zero Trust network concepts  
- Network segmentation to isolate sensitive assets  

These tools reduce the attack surface and prevent lateral movement.

### 3.4 Monitoring network activity  
Monitoring is essential for detection and response. I learned to interpret alerts and logs from:  
- Firewalls  
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)  
- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)  
- Packet capture tools (tcpdump and Wireshark)  

Understanding normal behaviour makes it easier to identify anomalies such as port scans, beaconing, suspicious DNS requests and unauthorised access attempts.

### 3.5 Common attacks and how to defend against them  
This module covered common network threats including:  
- Denial of service and distributed denial of service  
- Man in the middle attacks  
- IP spoofing  
- ARP poisoning  
- DNS poisoning  
- Port scanning  
- Unencrypted traffic interception  

For each threat I produced recommended defensive controls including encryption, segmentation, firewall hardening and protocol level protections.

## Reflection  
This course helped me become confident in evaluating the flow of network traffic and understanding how security tools interpret this data. 
Before this course I could recognise basic networking concepts but I did not fully understand how they linked to real security incidents. Now I can confidently read packet captures, understand why a network control is needed and explain how attacks occur across different network layers.

This has strengthened my ability to think like an analyst who must make decisions based on evidence from network behaviours rather than assumptions.
