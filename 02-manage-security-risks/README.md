# Course 2: Play It Safe - Manage Security Risks

## Why this topic matters
This course built my understanding of how organisations identify, evaluate and respond to risks that could impact critical assets, operations and people. 
As a future cybersecurity analyst, I need to demonstrate that I can think in terms of risk, communicate risk to stakeholders and recommend controls that improve an organisation’s security posture. This module helped me develop structured, repeatable ways to assess threats and map them to appropriate safeguards.

## Content

### 1. Controls and Compliance Assessment  
I analysed the security posture of a fictional toy company and evaluated the presence or absence of key controls. Examples included least privilege, separation of duties, multi factor authentication, encryption, disaster recovery planning, and password policies.  
I also reviewed compliance requirements for PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2.  
Key deliverables included:

- Identification of missing controls that would expose sensitive information  
- Recommendations to improve access management and monitoring  
- Mapping compliance gaps to specific regulatory expectations  
- Explaining why each missing control created operational or reputational risk

### 2. Security Risk Register  
I created a structured risk register using likelihood and impact scoring.  
Example risks included:

- Business email compromise  
- Poorly encrypted customer data  
- Publicly accessible backup databases  
- Supply chain disruptions  
- Physical theft scenarios

Each risk included a description, the threat source, likelihood, severity and an overall priority score. This helped me develop early competence with risk quantification.

### 3. Data Leak Analysis  
I worked through a real world style incident where an internal folder containing confidential product information was mistakenly shared publicly.  
Key tasks included:

- Identifying the access control failure  
- Mapping the issue to NIST SP 800 53 AC 6 (least privilege)  
- Documenting remediation steps  
- Explaining how misconfigured privileges can directly cause data exposure

This strengthened my understanding of how human error and weak processes lead to real incidents.

### 4. Hardening Techniques and Incident Documentation  
I practiced documenting an incident involving web server compromise and customer malware downloads.  
Main skills developed:

- Identifying the network protocol associated with the attack  
- Writing clear incident documentation for technical and non technical audiences  
- Recommending remediations such as MFA, strong password policies, regular firewall maintenance and anti brute force measures

This demonstrated my ability to translate technical findings into actionable improvements.

### 5. Vulnerability Assessment Reporting  
I completed a structured vulnerability assessment using NIST SP 800 30.  
Key elements included:

- Description of the system and its purpose  
- Scope definition  
- Threat sources and threat events  
- Likelihood and impact evaluation  
- Remediation strategy focusing on authentication, authorisation, auditing, encryption and IP allow listing

This helped me understand how organisations assess and communicate systemic weaknesses.

### 6. Social Engineering and USB Attack Scenario  
I analysed the risks associated with a lost USB drive containing personal data and sensitive internal documentation.  
I evaluated:

- How attackers could weaponise the information  
- Which technical and managerial controls could reduce the likelihood of exploitation  
- How awareness training and anti malware controls support defence in depth

## Reflection
This module significantly improved the way I think about security in terms of business impact rather than isolated technical issues. I learned how to frame problems using risk language that leaders understand and how to recommend controls that balance security with operational needs.  
Working through realistic scenarios helped me understand how small process failures, weak access controls, or misunderstandings can escalate into major incidents.  
After completing this course, I feel more confident in my ability to perform risk assessments, identify control gaps and communicate recommendations in a structured and professional way. This is an essential skill for a cybersecurity analyst and I am now able to demonstrate it clearly through examples in my portfolio.
