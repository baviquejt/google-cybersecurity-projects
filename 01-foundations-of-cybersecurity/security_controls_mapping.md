# Security Controls Mapping 

---

## 🔐 Common Threats & Controls

### 1. Phishing → Credential Theft

**Vulnerabilities**  
- Human error  
- Weak authentication  
- No verification step  

**Controls**  
- Security awareness training  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- Email filtering & attachment sandboxing  

---

### 2. Malware Infection

**Vulnerabilities**  
- Unpatched software  
- Poor endpoint protection  
- Users running unverified executables  

**Controls**  
- Endpoint detection & response (EDR)  
- Application allowlisting  
- Automated patching  

---

### 3. Unauthorized Access

**Vulnerabilities**  
- Excessive permissions  
- No role-based access controls  
- Unencrypted data  

**Controls**  
- Least privilege (NIST AC-6)  
- Encryption in transit & at rest  
- Access logging, monitoring, and audit trails  

---

### 4. Business Disruption / Data Loss

**Vulnerabilities**  
- No backup schedule  
- No disaster recovery plan  

**Controls**  
- Automated backup rotation  
- Disaster recovery & continuity planning  
- Infrastructure redundancy

## 🧠 Analyst Reflection

This exercise reinforced how important it is to match *specific* vulnerabilities with *targeted* security controls.  
Security isn’t solved by “more tools”, it’s solved by **the right controls applied in the right place**.
